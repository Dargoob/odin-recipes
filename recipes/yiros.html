        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>60g / 4 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (75g) flour</li>
            <li>4 cups (1 litre) milk (I use low fat)</li>
            <li>2 cups (200g) shredded cheese (Colby, Gruyere, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, OR 1 cup shredded parmesan)</li>
            <li>Pinch of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
            <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
            <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
        </ol>
